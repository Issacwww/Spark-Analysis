This program is aim to analyze some dataset with spark.

 `Part2.java` uses the spark.sql to query from a structured scheme (get from this [link](http://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/)).

The other three codes analyze a log file (get from this [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O6hqRANESPg38seu_UyjvTkxoctkntMD)), and compare the difference between cached RDD and uncached RDD.
